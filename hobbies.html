                <p><strong>Era of Eternals</strong> is an open zone multiplayer fighting game I'm developing solo,
                    where players level up through combat by inflicting damage on opponents. As
                    players progress, they unlock new zones, each offering unique challenges
                    and requiring different strategies. The game features a robust upgrade system,
                    allowing players to enhance abilities, unlock special moves, and access
                    powerful equipment. This combination of progression and customization
                    ensures a dynamic and engaging experience for all players.</p>

                <h3><strong>Golf</strong></h3>
                <p>Growing up, I competed in numerous golf tournaments, participating in both
                    the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) and the Golf Association of
                    Philadelphia (GAP) tournaments. During my time at The Hill School, I led
                    my golf team to a state championship and multiple league titles, showcasing
                    strong leadership and exceptional skill. Currently, I am a member of the
                    Villanova Club Golf Team and maintain a handicap of +0.3. My ongoing
                    engagement with the sport continues to be a source of personal discipline
                    and competitive achievement.</p>

                <h3><strong>Squash</strong></h3>
                <p>I started playing squash in the 8th grade, quickly developing a passion for
                    the game. By my sophomore year at The Hill School, my dedication and rapid
                    improvement earned me a spot on the Varsity squad, where I competed for
                    the next three years. During my time on the team, I worked diligently to
                    refine my skills and strategy, ultimately graduating with a commendable
                    4.1 rating. This rating reflects not only my technical proficiency but
                    also my deep understanding of the game and commitment to continuous improvement.</p>

                <h3><strong>Democracy and Education by John Dewey</strong></h3>
                <p>Diving into 'Democracy and Education' really opened my eyes to 
                    how education shapes our society. John Dewey makes you see that 
                    learning isn't just about prepping for your future; it's 
                    actually a key part of living a full life right now. His ideas 
                    on how education helps us think critically and act responsibly 
                    made me appreciate my own educational experiences so much more. 
                    It’s crazy how much impact teaching methods and school environments 
                    have on us—not just academically but also as citizens.</p>

                <h3><strong>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman</strong></h3>
                <p>Reading 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' really changed the way I look 
                    at decision-making. Daniel Kahneman explains how our minds work 
                    with two different systems — one fast and intuitive, the other 
                    slow and deliberate. It's fascinating and a bit alarming to 
                    realize how often I rely on quick judgments instead of taking 
                    the time to think things through. This book has made me more 
                    aware of my own thought processes and definitely encouraged me 
                    to question my gut feelings more often, especially in important 
                    decisions.</p>
